    <description>FsBlog aims to be a blog-aware static site generator, mostly built in F#. But don't worry,  you won't even need to know any F# to get up and running. So long as you are comfortable  using a command line or terminal, and have a degree of familiarity with Markdown and Razor  syntax - you're good to go!

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Property-based testing is a wonderful tool to verify correctness of your programs. 
However, some people struggle with finding reasonable cases to use the technique.
In this entry, I'll try to prove that property-based testing can be used in every-day coding by showing a rather &lt;strong&gt;exotic example&lt;/strong&gt; of applying property-based testing to check results of XSL transformations.&lt;/p&gt;
